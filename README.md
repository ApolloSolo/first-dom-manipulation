# first-dom-manipulation
change bg color and shape of div
This is my first attempt at manipulating the DOM through JS. I would like to figure out how to use js variables in the place of "rgb()" box.style.background = "rgb(red, green, blue)" where red, green, and blue are randomly generated numbers.
